# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!  

Iâ€™m currently migrating projects from an old GitHub account that was linked to my old entity.  
These include various academic and personal projects focused on web application development.  

### ðŸš§ Whatâ€™s Coming Soon?  
- Web development projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.).  
- Scripts and tools for automation.  
- Practice projects with frameworks like Symfony, Angular, and more.  

Feel free to explore my current repositories, and thank you for your patience as I populate this account! ðŸ˜Š
